This error occurs when using the `Dimensions` API in React Native to get screen dimensions.  The issue arises when the component that uses `Dimensions` is rendered before the `Dimensions` API has fully initialized, resulting in `undefined` values for `width` and `height`. This commonly happens when using the Dimensions API in a component that's mounted early in the app's lifecycle.
